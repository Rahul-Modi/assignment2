    <p>SIGNATURE EVENT means, in addition to a festival or special event as defined in this policy, an event that can be held annually and demonstrably is able to generate substantial direct impacts on the Whitehorse economy; attract a large contingent (Typically a large contingent implies that the nature, expected attendee level, duration or location challenges the normal response capacity of local first responders requiring special planning by one or more agencies to mitigate potential impacts on public health and safety) of out-of-town visitors and locals to the event; and includes the opportunity to leverage from the advanced media elements that support the potential to grow the event and promote Whitehorse as a choice destination.</p>
